1) Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay-person (e.g. your mum):

Command line is a way for us to interact with a computer program, issuing commands using text. From this, we can navigate through file and folders on our computer.





2) List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do:

- git add . (select all files in our local computer to get ready to send to our remote work directory online)
- git commit -m " " (take a 'snapshot' of changes we've made to our files and track them)
- git push  - send our local files to the offsite storage directory.
- git clone + repository name - make a exact copy of the files/directory remotely back to our local computer.
- git init - create a local repository in our folder.  I.E a place where our files can live.
- git branch - create a 'branch' of the master file, in other words a version of the master file that you can work on yourself and submit to, along with people.  This enables multiple people to contribute towards a project at the same time without their work conflicting with others.
- git checkout: lets you move to the repository that you want to go to (i.e. the directory where our projects live)
- git status: checks out the status of your repository, i.e. what files exist, what needs to be committed, and what branch your in(branch or master)
- git merge: merge your local branch(version of the master file), i.e. it merges your local files/folders back to a remote 'master' branch.
- git pull: downloads the most up to date version of the repository from GitHub.
